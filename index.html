                <p>Setting goals can be an effective way to help myself grow and develop, both personally and within my career. When someone sets goals for themself, they are ultimately approaching success with an open mind and making progress toward their goals that can allow improving their skills and knowledge and even learn new skills. So this year my focus is to improve my skills and set my own position in this programming world.</p>
